I am currently preparing for my PhD program application and <ins>am interested in opportunities as a **research assistant**</ins> in Human Behavior Remote Sensing, Human-Robot Interaction, or Human-Computer Interaction. I am very willing to learn hardware and firmware development if it is needed for the research.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Psychology, Human-Robot Interaction, and Digital Phenotyping. I have built systems and software interfaces focused on solving the replication issue between the lab and the real world by modeling authentic human behavior and implementing psychological paradigms into daily life.

Previously, I was an open-source developer and worked as a natural language processing engineer. I received my Master's degree in Psychology from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/), where I was a member of the Modeling and Informatics Lab under the advisement of [Prof. Tsung-Ren Huang](http://www.psy.ntu.edu.tw/index.php/members/faculty/fulltime-faculty/302-huang-tsung-ren). Additionally, I served as a student research assistant for the [Center for Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Robotics](https://ai.ntu.edu.tw/en/about-us/).
