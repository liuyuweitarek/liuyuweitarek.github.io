## Set Theory

### Sample space
All possible outcomes of a particular experiment, denoted by $\Omega$.

Every outcome in $\Omega$ is called an element , denoted by $w$. The element in $\Omega$ is denoted by $w \in \Omega$.

:::note
**Element in Sample space:**  $w \in \Omega$.

**Set belongs to Set:** $S_{A} \subseteq S_{B}$
:::

### Set operations
Let $A$ and $B$ be sets, and let ${A_{n}}$ be a sequence of subsets of $\Omega$.

#### 1. Subset 

$A$ is a subset of $B$, denoted as $A \subseteq B$, and every element in $A$ is also an element in $B$.

#### 2. Set Equality 

$A$ is equal to $B$, denoted as $A = B$. That is, $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$, both conditions hold simultaneously.

#### 3. Null Set

The null set, denoted as $\varnothing$, is a set that contains no elements.

#### 4. Complement Set 

The complement of set $A$, denoted as $A^{c}$, is the set of all elements in $\Omega$ that are not in $A$.
$$
A^{c} = \{ w \mid w \in \Omega \land w \not \in A \}
$$

#### 5. Union

The union of sets $A$ and $B$, denoted as $A \cup B$, is the set of all elements in $A$ and $B$.
$$
A \cup B = \{ w \mid w \in A \lor w \in B \}
$$

#### 6. Intersection

The intersection of sets $A$ and $B$, denoted as $A \cap B$, is the set of all elements in $A$ and $B$.
$$
A \cap B = \{ w \mid w \in A \land w \in B \}
$$

#### 7. Set Difference

**$A \backslash B$**: The set of all elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$:

$$  
A \backslash B = A \cap B^{c} =\{ w \mid w \in A \land w \not \in B \}
$$

**$B \backslash A$**: The set of all elements that are in $B$ but not in $A$:

$$  
B \backslash A = B \cap A^{c} = \{ w \mid w \in B \land w \not \in A \}
$$  

#### 8. Disjoint or Mutually Exclusive  

If $A$ and $B$ have no common elements, they are called disjoint sets, denoted as $A \cap B = \varnothing$. 


#### 9. Upper Limit

$$
{\limsup}_{n} \bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty} \bigcup_{n=k}^{\infty} A_{n} = \{w \mid w \in A_{n} \text{ for infinitely many values of n }\}
$$

#### 10. Lower Limit 

$$
{\liminf}_{n} \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty} \bigcap_{n=k}^{\infty} A_{n} = \{w \mid w \in A_{n} \text{ for all but finitely many values of n }\}
$$

#### 11. Set Convergence

The sequence $\{A_{n} \}$ converges to $A$ if ${\limsup}_{n}A_{n} = {\liminf}_{n}A_{n} = A$, which is denoted by $\lim_{n \to \infty} A_{n} = A$.

### Generalization to Multiple Sets

The operations of union and intersection <u>can be extended to any finite or infinite number of sets.</u>

**Extend operation to finite sets**

Let $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{n}$ be subsets of $S$, such that each $A_{i} \subseteq S$ for $i=1, 2, \ldots, n$. 

Their <u>union</u> is denoted as:

$$
A_{1} \cup A_{2} \cup \cdots \cup A_{n} = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_{i} = \{ x \mid x \in A_{1} \lor x \in A_{2} \lor \ldots \lor x \in A_{i} \,,  \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\}
$$

, and their <u>intersection</u> is denoted as:

$$
A_{1} \cap A_{2} \cap \cdots \cap A_{n} = \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_{i} = \{ x \mid x \in A_{1} \land x \in A_{2} \land \ldots \land x \in A_{i} \,, \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\}
$$

**Extend operation to infinite sets**

Let $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{n}$ be subsets of $S$, such that each $A_{i} \subseteq S$ for $i=1, 2, \ldots, n, \ldots$. 

Their <u>union</u> is denoted as:

$$
A_{1} \cup A_{2} \cup \cdots \cup A_{n} \cup \cdots= \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_{i} = \{ x \mid x \in A_{1} \lor x \in A_{2} \lor \ldots \lor x \in A_{i} \,,  \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n, \ldots\}\}
$$

, and their <u>intersection</u> is denoted as:

$$
A_{1} \cap A_{2} \cap \cdots \cap A_{n} \cap \cdots = \bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} A_{i} = \{ x \mid x \in A_{1} \land x \in A_{2} \land \ldots \land x \in A_{i} \,, \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n, \ldots\}\}
$$

### Properties

1. Commutativity: $A \cup B = B \cup A$ ; $A \cap B = B \cap A$

2. Associativity: $(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)$ ; $(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)$

3. Distributive Law: $A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$ ; $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$

4. DeMorgen's Law: ${(A \cup B)}^{c} = A^{c} \cap B^{c}$ ; ${(A \cap B)}^{c} = A^{c} \cup B^{c}$
