## Random Experiment
The study of probability originates from experiments with uncertain outcomes, referred to as random experiments.

1. A random experiment is an experiment whose outcome cannot be predicted in advance.
2. A random experiment <b><i>can be repeated under identical conditions</i></b>.
3. The probability of a random experiment can be given by the number of favourable outcomes / total number of outcomes.

### Sample Space
The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. 

It is denoted by $S$, and it is the universe of all possible outcomes.

### Sample Point
A sample point is a specific outcome of a random experiment. It is denoted by $x$, and it is a member of the sample space $S$.

### Examples

1. Consider a random experiment in which a fair coin is tossed repeatedly until the first occurrence of a heads ($H$). Let $H$ represent heads and $T$ represent tails. Then, the sample space $S$ is given by:

    $$
    S = \{H, TH, TTH, ...\}
    $$

    where each outcome $x \in S$ corresponds to a finite sequence of tosses ending with the first occurrence of heads. Formally, each sample point can be represented as:

    $$
    x =  T^{k-1}H, \quad k \in \mathbb{N}
    $$

    where $k$ denotes the trial number on which the first heads occurs, and $T^{k-1}$ represents $k-1$ consecutive tails before the heads.

2. Consider a random experiment in which ramdomly sample the lifespan of light bulbs in a factory. Let $t$ represent the lifespan(in hours) of a bulb. Then, the sample space $S$ is given by:

    $$
    S = \{t: t \ge 0\} 
    $$


Based on the different properties of sample points within the sample space, the sample space can be classified into <u>discrete sample space</u> and <u>continuous sample space</u>.

### Discrete Sample Space
A sample space is called a discrete sample space if all its sample points can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of positive integers($\mathbb{N}$).

### Continuous Sample Space
A sample space is called a continuous sample space if all its sample points form a continuous set, such as an interval or a region in the Euclidean space $R^{k}$, where 
$ùëò$ represents the dimensionality of the region.

---

### Event
A subset of a sample space whose elements share a common property is called an event.

#### Elementary Event
For any sample point $x$ in the sample space $S$ the set ${x}$ is called an elementary event.

#### Occurrence of an Event
Given a random experiment where an outcome $x$ is observed, and an event $A \subseteq S$, if $x \in A$, then event $ùê¥$ is said to have occurred.

#### Sure Event(Certain Event)
The event that always occurs. In probability theory, this is simply the sample space $S$ itself, which includes every possible outcome of a random experiment.

#### Null Event
Let $\varnothing$ be an element of $S$. Since $\varnothing$ contains no sample points from $S$, it is called the null event.

#### Example
Toss a fair coin 3 times. Let $H$ represent heads and $T$ represent tails. Then, the sample space $S$ is given by:
    $$  
    S = \{HHH, HHT, HTT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, TTT\}
    $$
Let 
    $$
    A_{i}=\{\text{ i heads occurred during the 3 tosses }\} \text{, where } i=0,1,2,3
    $$
Then
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    A_{0} &= \{TTT\} \\
    A_{1} &= \{HTT, TTH, THT\} \\
    A_{2} &= \{THH, HTH, HHT\} \\
    A_{3} &= \{HHH\}
    \end{align*}
    $$
According to the above definition,
- All $A_{i}$ are events.
- $A_{0}$, $A_{3}$ are elementary events.
- If $\{HTT\}$ happenned, then is so called $A_{1}$ happened, $A_{0}$, $A_{2}$ and $A_{3}$ not happened.
