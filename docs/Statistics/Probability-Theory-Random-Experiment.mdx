## Random Experiment
The study of probability originates from experiments with uncertain outcomes, referred to as random experiments.

1. A random experiment is an experiment whose outcome cannot be predicted in advance.
2. A random experiment <b><i>can be repeated under identical conditions</i></b>.
3. The probability of a random experiment can be given by the number of favourable outcomes / total number of outcomes.

### Sample Space
The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. 

It is denoted by $S$, and it is the universe of all possible outcomes.

### Sample Point
A sample point is a specific outcome of a random experiment. It is denoted by $x$, and it is a member of the sample space $S$.

### Examples

1. Consider a random experiment in which a fair coin is tossed repeatedly until the first occurrence of a heads ($H$). Let $H$ represent heads and $T$ represent tails. Then, the sample space $S$ is given by:

    $$
    S = \{H, TH, TTH, ...\}
    $$

    where each outcome $x \in S$ corresponds to a finite sequence of tosses ending with the first occurrence of heads. Formally, each sample point can be represented as:

    $$
    x =  T^{k-1}H, \quad k \in \mathbb{N}
    $$

    where $k$ denotes the trial number on which the first heads occurs, and $T^{k-1}$ represents $k-1$ consecutive tails before the heads.

2. Consider a random experiment in which ramdomly sample the lifespan of light bulbs in a factory. Let $t$ represent the lifespan(in hours) of a bulb. Then, the sample space $S$ is given by:

    $$
    S = \{t: t \ge 0\} 
    $$
