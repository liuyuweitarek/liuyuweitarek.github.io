## Simulate a neuron with PyTorch

Following with the video, I will implement a neural network for a neuron using PyTorch, observing how to simulate and approximate the all-or-none laws of physics through real-world observed data. See more details in [my Google Colab Playground](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_Qy1WdfnL1dPLt_022MUn6tHo0RTGExo?usp=sharing).
