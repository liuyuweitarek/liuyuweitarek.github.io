# Prerequisites

My dev stack is composed of:

1. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

   If your operating system is Windows, you might need to launch WSL2 first.

2. [VScode IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

3. VScode extension **Remote - Containers**.

   1. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the left sidebar or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (Mac).
   2. Search for **"Remote - Containers"** in the search bar.
   3. Click on the "Install" button next to the "Remote - Containers" extension.
   4. Once the extension is installed, you can follow the instructions provided in the extension's documentation to set up and use it with your project.

   Please note that the **"VSCode Remote - Containers"** extension allows you to develop inside a containerized environment, which can be useful for Flutter projects that require specific dependencies or configurations.

# Getting Started

1. In local terminal:

   ```bash
   $ docker compose --profile dev up --build -d
   ```

2. Open VScode command palette, search "Remote-Containers: Attach to running container" in the search bar and click on the running container name that your just launched.

# Development

1. In container terminal:

   ```bash
   $ npm start
   ```

2. Local build:

   ```bash
   $ npm run build
   ```

3. Renew Algolia DocSearch Index. See more in [renew-algolia-docsearch-index.mdx](./renew-algolia-docsearch-index.mdx)
